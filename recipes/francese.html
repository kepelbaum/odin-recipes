        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup white wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 medium lemons, juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Dredge chicken in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour again to coat both sides. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and sauté until almost cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Heat chicken broth, wine, butter, lemon juice, parsley, salt, and pepper in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until butter melts. Stir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until combined; add to broth mixture and cook until it thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place chicken into the prepared baking dish and pour sauce over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
